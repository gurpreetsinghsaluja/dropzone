## A simple React.js project in which React dropzone component is implemented.

- Files can be dragged and drop, or, clicked in the dropzone area to select files to be put on the site.

- After selection of files, a progress bar shows, which simulated uploading of the files when the submit button is clicked.
- Custodian of the files can also be entered as a input.
- A checklist is implemented for the files, and only the files checked by the user will be simulated to be uploaded.
- The timer of the progress bar is simulated in proportion to the size of the file selected.
